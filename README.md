Calculator project assignment for The Odin Project

My goal is to create a calculator per the instructions, modelled off a typical keyboard's number pad with a few minor tweaks.

I took a break from this because I was struggling with flexbox to create a layout that I wanted for the calculator. Originally I wanted to emulate a keyboard's numberpad, and this proved harder than I imagined. After taking a break I then began to struggle with using JavaScript to manipulate the DOM. However as of 29/03/23 I can say that the project meets most criteria. Unlike the etch-a-sketch project, I will actually return to this soon to iron out some immediate problems and satisfy all criteria. At some point I need to work with the stylesheet to make the page look more pleasant. I would also like to branch this project and restyle the calculator pad so that it does actually resemble a keyboard's number pad, though I will likely need to grow more confident with flexbox or learn CSS Grid.

As of 04/04/23, I have solved most problems with how the calculator works, what's left now is to really make it look nice, but I'll likely do that bit by bit over time. I would also like to make the calculator work with floats/decimals at some point.

In summary:
- [x] Allow calculator to continue performing calculations, using the last result as the first value
- [x] Spend time styling the calculator
- [x] Fix NaN bug when using operator is evaluated before using numbers
- [x] Allow user to use negative numbers
- [x] Prevent user from dividing by 0
- [ ] Rearrange the button layout so it can be scaled properly
- [ ] Alter the layout to resemble a keyboard's number pad in another branch
- [ ] Allow calculator to work with floats/decimals
