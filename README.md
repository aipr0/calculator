Calculator project assignment for The Odin Project

My second attempt as of 2024.

So I've completed this. Pretty happy with it. Looks a lot better than my last attempt. Likely because I didn't take my sweet time getting around to it. Well I kind of did. I'm not really sure to be honest. That's besides the point. It's done and it's better. That being said there's still a lot of faults but I'm going to be moving on for now. I intend to come back to this but whether I actually do or not who can say. I said it about the last project after all.
